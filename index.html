            <h4>How This Works: <br></h4>

            <p>This is a website that gathers posts from different users, shows their
                reactions and the comments to the posts.</br>
                Clicking on a user profile will display their information (restricted to
                name, username, email and phone).
            </p>

            <p>These are the following tabs that are currently available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>"Home"</b>: the current window where you can navigate  to different pages.</li>
                <li><b>"Posts"</b> where you can see an archive of posts and their respective 
                comments, reactions and author.</li>
                <li><b>"Contact us"</b>: A form you can fill out that requires you to enter
                    a username, an email (@ and . required) and a tickbox that is required
                    to be checked before submitting.
                </li>
            </ul>
